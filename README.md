# Current Projects:
* Scripts - A collection of scripts I have written that make my everyday life/tasks easier. Some are just there because.
* Neovim and GNU emacs configs - I don't use emacs often anymore but it's there. 

# Future Projects: (Maybe looking for collaborators)
* Samantha OS
* A qtile/i3 rice focused on following the concepts from the digital minimalism book by Cal Newport
