# Current Projects:
* Scripts - A collection of scripts I have written that make my everyday life/tasks easier. Some are just there because.
* Neovim and GNU emacs configs - I don't use emacs often anymore but it's there. 

# Future Projects:
* Pomodoro study tracker and timer
* Refactor my dotfiles (include qtile and bspwm)
